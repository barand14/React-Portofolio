      <img src={Balalomba} alt="Balalomba Barandao" />
      <p>Extremely down to earth, I try my best to get along with people or most people, to be concise.
         I am a big fan of sports in general and mos paticulary, soccer.
         I also love science and technology which have led my curiosity to this bootcamp. With no coding
         background, I accepted my inner call to explore this field completely strange to my knowledge.
         We are now almost at the end of this bootcamp and can say that I have learned quite a lot and to be honest , 
         it has been and continue to be a huge challenge and I know it always going to be. </p>

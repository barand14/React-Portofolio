      <p>Extremely down to earth, I try my best to get along with people or most people, to be concise.
                I'm a big fan of sport in general and soccer specifically.
                I also love science and technology which have led my curiosity to this bootcamp. With no coding
                background, I accepted my inner call to explore this field completely strange to my knowledge.
                // eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities
                More than half way through this bootcamp, I've learned quite a lot and to be honest , it has been and continue to be a huge challenge. </p>
